The comparison operators can be chained.  \n","4.

In strings the Capitalisation counts.   \n","\n","\n","### Arithmetic Operators: \n","1. These operations are applied on the numeric types (integer, floating point and complex number). Python supports mixed arithmetic operations (between diffferent numeric type)  -the operand with the narrow type is widened to that of the other (integer <floating point <complex) <br>\n","\n","2. The following operators are used for the arithmetic operations: <br>\n","(+) Addition,  (-) Substraction , ( * ) Multiplication <br> \n","(/) Division - Returns Float, (**) Exponential  <br>\n","Pow(x, y): x to the power y, <br> \n","(%) Modulus - gives you the renainder of a division.<br> \n","(//) Floor Division - also refered to as integer division. The resultant value is a whole integer, not necessarily of type int.  The results are always rounded towards minus infinity.  <br> \n","Abs(X)  :absolute value of x <br> \n","Int(X):  converted to int <br>\n","Float(X): converted to float <br>\n","Divmod(x,y): the pair (x//y, x%y) <br> \n","\n"," \n","<b>Concatenation:</b> <br>\n","1. Join two or more strings.  \n","2. Use the '+' operator. \n","3. Since the concatenation is applied to strings, to concatenate string with other types, you have to do an explicit type cast using str()\n","\n","\n","### Assignment Operators:\n","1. Operator are used to assign value to variable.  \n","2. Value on right and variable on left \n","3. Following are the assignment operator: += [addition and assign] , -= ,  *= ,  /=,  %=,  //=,  **= \n","\n","\n","### Membership Operators: \n","1. These operators provide an easy way to check if a certain object is present in a sequence. \n","2. Used with: Strings, list, tuples, sets, dictionay \n","3.
